Level 1: Prime Numbers

The first goal was to find an identifier for a new employee at the “minions” company.

The identifier is selected base on a random number i. How do we come from the random integer i to the identifier of the new minion employee?

Create a sequence of prime numbers '23571113...'.
The identifier is the subsequence starting from index i and ending in index i+4 (included).
The value i is an integer between 0 and 10000.

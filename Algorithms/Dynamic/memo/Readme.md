# Memoization

## Reciepie

### 1. Make it work.
- visualize the problem as a tree
- implement the tree using recursion
- test it

### 2. Make it efficient
- add a memo object
- add a base case to return memo values
- store return values in memo



## Objective

If a solution of a problem has been previously solved then we use that solution directly when the same quetion arrives.

## Data Structure
We use hashmap as a data structure in memoization to store the question as a key and solution as a pair.

### Inbuilt Data Structures/Libraries for Implementation
- unordered_map in C++
- hashmap in Java
- dictionary in Python
- object in Javascript

## Complexity
Time Complexity 
- Best case: O(1)
- Worst case : O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
